They should be in a dictionary object. The dictionary keys should be the parameters names as Symbol (with a colon \":\" before the name). See the Tutorial page for an example of the parameters dictionary.","category":"page"},{"location":"api/","page":"API","title":"API","text":"ploidy: A tuple specifying the ploidy of each species. Currently only support ploidy=1 (haploid) and ploidy=2 (diploid).\nphenotypes: A tuple specifying the number of phenotypes p for each species.\nngenes: A tuple specifying the number of genes l for each species.\ngrowthrates: A tuple specifying growth rate for each species. Growth rates are for a logistic growth model, where N_t+1 = N_t + rtimes N_t times (1 - ((N_t  K)), where N is population size, t is time, r is growth rate and K is carrying capacity. If r=0, population size remains constant.\ninteractionCoeffs: A matrix containing competition coefficients between each pair of species. A competition coefficient c_ij denotes the strength of competition exerted by an individual of species j on an individual of species i.\ninteraction_equation: either \"lotkaVolterageneralized\" (if you want host-parasite or predator prey dynamics) or \"lotkaVolteracompetition\". Default is \"lotkaVolteracompetition\". The LV competition equation is as follows. It uses the Lotka-Voltera equation Ni{t+1} = Nit + r\\times Nit \\times (1 - ((Nit + \\sum{j=1}^{Nspecies} c{ij}Njt)/Ki)$ where c is competition coefficient. When competition coefficient is positive, population j competes with population i. If negative, population j helps population i to grow. And if 0, population j does not affect population i. If c_ij  0 and c_ji  0, both populations are in competition, if c_ij  0 and c_ji  0, species i is a parasite of species j. If c_ij  0 and c_ji  0, the two species have a mutualistic relationship. If c_ij  0 and c_ji = 0, they have a commensal relationship. It can also be nothing. The generalized Lotka-Voltera equation is $ x{t+1} = xt + D(x_t)(r + Cx)  where x is an array population densities of all species (NK), r is an array of growth rates when growing alone, C is interaction coefficient matrix.\npleiotropyMat: A tuple of pleiotropy matrices, one for each species. A pleitropy matrix is a binary matrix with size p times l that specifies the phenotypes that each locus affects.\nepistasisMat: A tuple of epistasis matrices, one for each species. An epistasis matrix is of size l times l and specifies the direction (positive or negative) and size of effect of one loci on the other loci. For example, if at row 1 and column 2 is a value 0.2, it means that locus 1 affects locus 2 by increasing the effect of locus 2 (because its positive) with 20% of the effect of locus 1. The effect of loci are themselves specified in the q vector.\nexpressionArrays: A tuple of expression arrays, one for each species. An expression array q shows the effect size of a locus. It can be thought of expression level of a gene.\nselectionCoeffs: A tuple  of selection coefficients for each species.\noptPhenotypes: A tuple of arrays, where each inner array specifies optimal phenotypes θ for each species. Each inner array should be of length p (number of phenotypes) of its corresponding species.\ncovMat: A tuple of matrices, each of which ω represents a covariance matrix of the selection surface. Each matrix is of size ptimes p.\nmutProbs: A tuple of arrays, one per species. Each inner array specifies the probabilities for different type of mutations. An inner array has three values with the following order: first, the probability that an individual's gene expressions (array q) mutate per generation. Second, the probability that an individual's pleiotropy matrix mutates per generation. Third, the probability that an individual's epistasis matrix mutates per generation. If an individual is going to receive a mutation at any of the mentioned levels, the amount of change that it receives is determined by mutMagnitudes.\nmutMagnitudes: A tuple of arrays, one for each species. Each inner array has three numbers specifying the amount of change per mutation in gene expression (q), pleiotropy matrix (b), and epistasis matrix a, respectively. The first number is the variance of a normal distribution with mean zero. If an individual's gene expression is going to mutate, random numbers from that distribution are added to the expression of each locus. The second number is a probability that any one element in the pleiotropy matrix will switch - if on, becomes off, and vice versa. The third number is again the variance of another normal distribution with mean zero. Random numbers taken from such distribution are added to each element of the epistasis matrix.\nN: A dictionary where each key is a node number and its value is a tuple for population size of each species at that node. This dictionary does not have to have a key for all the nodes, but it should have a value for all the species.\nK: A dictionary where each key is a node number and its value is tuple of carrying capacities K of the node for each species. The dictionary should have a key for all the nodes and carrying capacity for each species per node.\nmigration_rates: An array of matrices, each matrix shows migration rates between each pair of nodes for a species. The rows and columns of the matrix are node numbers in order. Values are read column-wise: each column shows out-migration to all other nodes from a node. If instead of a matrix, there is nothing, no migration occurs for that species.\nE: A tuple  of the variance of a normal distribution ε representing environmental noise for each species.\ngenerations: number of generations to run the simulation.\nspace: (default=nothing) Either a tuple of size 2 or 3 for a grid size or a SimpleGraph object for an arbitrary graph. If it is a tuple, a grid is built internally\nmoore: (default=false) Whether nodes in the grid have 8 neighbors (Moore neighborhood). Default is false, i.e. cells only have 4 neighbors.\nperiodic: (default=false) If space is 2D, should the edges connect to the opposite side?\nseed: (default=0). Seed for random number generator. Only set if >0.","category":"page"},{"location":"api/#Simulation-outline","page":"API","title":"Simulation outline","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"api/","page":"API","title":"API","text":"Within each time-step, the following occurs:","category":"page"},{"location":"api/","page":"API","title":"API","text":"Mutation\nFitness update\nMigration\nReproduction (only for diploids)\nselection","category":"page"},{"location":"api/#Mutation","page":"API","title":"Mutation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"api/","page":"API","title":"API","text":"Mutation can happen at three levels: changing the expression of each gene expressionArrays, changing the pleiotropy matrix pleiotropyMat, and changing the epistatic interactions between genes.
